## Intro
In this project, Selenium WebDriver is used to test basic functionalities of my final paper web application, which is hosted via firebase hosting services and the link to the hosted app is here: https://zavrsni-3652b.web.app/

The app source code(copyrights by FERIT and me) is available here: https://github.com/Zokky2e/zavrsniv1.0
## Prerequisites
### After cloning and running in Visual Studio
Check if you have the required NuGet packages

Packages:
* NUnit framework (3.13.3)
* Selenium WebDriver (4.6.0)
* Selenium Support(4.6.0)
* Nunit3 Test Adapter (4.3.1)
* Selenium WebDriver – Gecko Driver (0.32.0) – for firefox browser
## Running the tests
### In Visual Studio
* Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer
* Tests are visible only after innital build
* Build -> Build Solution
* In Test Explorer -> Run Tests(the green arrow)
* Sit, relax and watch tests pass with ease

## Final words
After trying out automated tests, I've come with 2 conclusions
* Automated frontend tests make repetitive actions quicker
* Automated tests can be a pain if the frontend does not have unique ids on elements
